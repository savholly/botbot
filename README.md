# Bot Bot
Bot Bot is a Discord bot I made for my server that I created for my high school friend group. For those who do not know, Discord is a messaging platform with both text and voice capabilities. Bots can be added to Discord servers in order to accomplish a wide variety of things, and just for fun! Bot Bot works by reading all the text messages in the server, and once a message with his command prefix (!) is sent, he reads in the following text and searches for a command to match it. Bot Bot has the ability to send messages back to the user who called a command.   
The following commands have been implemented so far:  
**!hello** - Greets the user who called the command. Takes no parameters.    
**!dog** - Returns a random image of a dog. Takes no parameters.  
**!cat** - Returns a random image of a cat. Takes no parameters.  
**!happy** - Adds what the user types after !happy to a list to be used with !sad, the list resets when the bot is restarted. Takes one parameter: the item that makes you happy as a string.  
**!sad** - Returns a randomly selected item from the list populated by !happy. Takes no parameters.  
**!calc** - Performs basic 4 function operations. Takes three parameters: the first number as a double, the operation as a string, and the second number as a double.  
**!weather** - Returns the weather for the city requested by the user. Takes one parameter: the city for which to return the weather as a string.  
**!avery** - Avery is my boyfriend, and his favorite show is Breaking Bad. This command returns a random Breaking Bad quote. Takes no parameters.    
**!coin** - Returns the results of a coin flip. Takes no parameters.  
**!dice** - Returns the results of a dice role, the number of sides is determined by the user. Takes one parameter: the number of sides for the dice as an integer.  
**!joke** - Returns a random joke. Takes no parameters.  
**!meme** - Returns a random meme. Takes no parameters.  
**!rockpaperscissors** - Returns the results of a game of rock, paper, scissors with the bot. Takes one parameter: Your choice of rock, paper, or scissors as a string.
