# Bot Bot
Bot Bot is a Discord bot I made for my server that I created for my high school friend group. For those who do not know, Discord is a messaging platform with both text and voice capabilities. Bots can be added to Discord servers in order to accomplish a wide variety of things, and just for fun! Bot Bot works by reading all the text messages in the server, and once a message with his command prefix (!) is sent, he reads in the following text and searches for a command to match it. Bot Bot has the ability to send messages back to the user who called a command. 
The following commands have been implemented so far:
!hello - Greets the user who called the command.
!dog - Returns a random image of a dog.
!cat - Returns a random image of a cat.
!happy - Adds what the user types after !happy to a list to be used with !sad, the list resets when the bot is restarted.
!sad - Returns a randomly selected item from the list populated by !happy.
!calc - Performs basic 4 function operations.
!weather - Returns the weather for the city requested by the user.
!avery - Avery is my boyfriend, and his favorite show is Breaking Bad. This command returns a random Breaking Bad quote.
!coin - Returns the results of a coin flip.
!dice - Returns the results of a dice role, the number of sides is determined by the user.
!joke - Returns a random joke.
!meme - Returns a random meme.
!rockpaperscissors - Returns the results of a game of rock, paper, scissors with the bot.
